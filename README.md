PQonGmaps
=======

Rubycom is a webcomic downloader and viewer application, just like dailystrips.
It's written in RubyOnRails and, um... it's great.

It started as a personal project, but perhaps someone wants to use (or even contribute) to it...


Installation
------------

`git@github.com:rene-dev/pqongmaps.git` 
`rake db:migrate`
Make sure the ruby has permissions to write into `uploads`.
`ruby -rubygems app.rb`
upload a gpx file on http://localhost:4567/upload
